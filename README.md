## React Native Biometric Authentication Example

This is a simple React Native application that demonstrates how to implement biometric authentication using the Expo framework. The app allows users to log in using their username and password, and it also supports biometric authentication for enhanced security.

### Features
- Username and password login
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID, etc.) using Expo Local Authentication
- Secure storage of user credentials using Expo SecureStore

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Install Expo CLI globally by running `npm install -g expo-cli`.
3. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-native-biometric-auth`.
5. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
6. Run the application: `expo start`.

### Usage
- When you launch the app, you will see a login screen.
- Enter your username and password.
- You can also choose to use biometric authentication by tapping on the biometric icon (fingerprint, face ID, etc.).
- If the entered credentials are correct or biometric authentication is successful, you will be redirected to the home screen.
